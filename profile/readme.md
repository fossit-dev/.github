# Fossit
A successor to [Src Skol](https://github.com/Src-Skol) & [TN Decompiled](https://github.com/TN-Decompile)\
Fossit uses [ext-watcher](https://github.com/ading2210/ext-watcher) and Github Actions to automatically update the source code for common filters found at schools.

## Filter List
- Securly

If you have a filter that is not listed here please:
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` or `chrome://extensions-internals` and find your filter
- Note down the extensions ID
- Then visit `chrome-extension://*extension id*/manifest.json`
- Then DM the user `scaratech` (on Discord) the extension ID and `manifest.json`
